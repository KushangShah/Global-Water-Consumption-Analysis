### üîü Distribution of Water Use by Sector
![Distribution of Water Use by Sector](./images/chart%2010.png)
**Description:**
- Agriculture is the dominant water consumer, meaning policies for water conservation should focus here.
- Industrial and household water use are significantly lower, but they still need efficient management.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Total water consumption V/S GroundWater Depletion
![Total water consumption V/S GroundWater Depletion](./images/chart%2011.png)**Description:**
- The data points are widely scattered across all values of water consumption and depletion rate.
- This suggests that total water consumption alone may not be the sole factor driving groundwater depletion.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Water Consumption Trend Over Time (Top 5 Countries)
![Water Consumption Trend Over Time (Top 5 Countries)](./images/chart%2013.png)**Description:**
- The water consumption trend for each country varies significantly, with sharp ups and downs.
- This suggests that water consumption is not constant and is influenced by multiple factors like population growth, climate change, industrial demand, and government policies.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ water Scarcity V/S Total Water consumption

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Groundwater Depletion vs. Rainfall Impact
![Groundwater Depletion vs. Rainfall Impact](./images/chart%2015.png)
_Description: (To find out if low rainfall leads to high groundwater depletion? No, This chart suggests that rainfall alone is not a major factor in preventing groundwater depletion. Other factors, such as water consumption, urbanization, and agricultural practices, might be playing a larger role.)_

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Most Water-Stressed Countries
![Top 10 Most Water-Stressed Countries](./images/chart%2016.png)
**Description:**
- Spain, Canada, and Mexico have higher water scarcity levels, suggesting high demand and limited availability.
- South Africa, France, and Russia have lower water scarcity levels, indicating either better water management or lower demand.
- Mexico has the highest depletion rate, exceeding 2.9%.
- Argentina and Spain also have high depletion rates, suggesting unsustainable groundwater use.
- South Africa and France have lower depletion rates, implying better conservation or reliance on alternative water sources.
- Some countries (e.g., Mexico, Argentina, Spain) experience both high water scarcity and high groundwater depletion, indicating a severe water crisis.
- Others (e.g., France, Russia) have low scarcity but still depleting groundwater, which could become problematic in the future.
- The shaded regions suggest significant variability or uncertainty in data, meaning that water scarcity and depletion rates fluctuate over time.
